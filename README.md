## About the project (IN DEVELOPMENT)
The name is " LEFT 4 DEAD 3 " - a zombie apocalyse game in that we will play as survivor trying to go through thousands of blood thirsty, aggressive zombies.

This project is inspired by a similar web-browser game surviv.io:

## The features
We expect our project would have some main features:
  - player can move and control survivor to move and shoot zombies, also, they are able to interact with object likes crate to get ammo, health kit, etc.
  - zombies are our main enemy, they will chase after player to attack.

Furthermore, its nice to have some more feature added:
