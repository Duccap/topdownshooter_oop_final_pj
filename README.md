# Project kill us's OOP Project


## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1. Motivation

This project is created with purpose to not only pass the OOP course, but to also gain valuable knowledge regarding the uses of Java programming language and the application of OOP's core principles. In addition, our team has been able to learn how a simple (yet not really simple) Java 2D game functions, using only the internal Java libraries.

### 4. FEATURES:

#### Completed:

1. Basic character's movements/actions. ✅
2. Wizard has health bar, which mean he will die when it drains. ✅
3. Ability to gain ammo from crates. ✅

#### Incompleted:

1. Not yet a multi-threaded game (still single). ❌
2. The monster can follow player. ❌
3. The monster spawner is not yet made => No monster waves yet. ❌
4. The codes in multiple parts are still quite messy and not optimized. ❌
5. multiplayer ❌❌

#### To be developed:

1. Improve/Fix/add the above 5 incompleted features.
2. Add more variety to the game (bosses, soundtrack,...) => Make it more lively, hardcore, fastpaced

### 5. CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED:

1. Most of the team members are not familiar with Java and OOP yet, some of us had trouble dealing with Git command.
2. Most of the team members are not able to read and understand codes thoroughly.
3. Problems with the IDE, file lost, etc.

### 6. RESULT / CONCLUSION:

### 7. WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED SO FAR:

1. Getting used to a new programming language (Java).
2. Understanding a little bit more about the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
3. Getting used to some common yet extremely important actions & commands for GitHub.
4. Getting to know the basics of a Java 2D game, as well as the ways to make one from complete scratch.
5. Learning how to colaborate with each other in a team of newly associated people.
6. Enhancing teamwork ability.
